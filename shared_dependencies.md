Shared Dependencies:

1. Function Names:
   - `authenticate` (shared between `app.py` and potentially `database.py` if authentication involves database access)

2. Parameters and Variables:
   - `username` (used in `authenticate` function)
   - `password` (used in `authenticate` function)

3. Data Schemas:
   - User schema (likely shared between `app.py`, `database.py`, and possibly `scraper.py` if it scrapes user-related data)

4. Configuration Variables:
   - `DEBUG` (used in `app.py` to determine the mode of the Flask application)
   - `PORT` (used in both `app.py` and `Dockerfile` to align the ports)

5. File and Directory Names:
   - `client` (directory name for static files, referenced in `app.py`)

6. DOM Element IDs (if the JavaScript interacts with specific elements served by Flask):
   - These would be specific to the front-end JavaScript files and are not detailed in the prompt, but they would be shared between the JavaScript files and the HTML templates served by Flask.

7. Message Names:
   - Any specific error or success messages related to authentication or database operations (shared between `app.py` and `database.py`)

8. Parsing Logic Identifiers:
   - Custom parsing function names or identifiers (used in `scraper.py`)

9. Docker Configuration:
   - `EXPOSE` directive (used in `Dockerfile`)

Please note that without the actual code or a more detailed description of the system, this list is based on common practices and assumptions. Actual shared dependencies may vary based on the specific implementation details of the application.
