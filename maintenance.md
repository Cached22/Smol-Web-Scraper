# Web Scraper and Crawler Application Maintenance Guide

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Daily Tasks
- Check the application logs for any unusual activity or errors.
- Verify that the `monitoring_config.json` is correctly reporting system health.
- Ensure that the scraper jobs initiated via `/start` are completing successfully.

### Weekly Tasks
- Review the performance metrics and optimize the `scraper.py` module if necessary.
- Update the `database.py` module to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Test all API endpoints (`/start`, `/results`, `/status`) to confirm they are functioning as expected.

### Monthly Tasks
- Audit security measures and update the `authenticate` function to incorporate any new security best practices.
- Perform a code review of `app.py` to refactor and improve the code quality.
- Check for updates on dependencies and apply them to avoid security vulnerabilities.

## On-demand Maintenance Tasks

### Post-deployment Checks
- After deploying using `deploy.sh`, monitor the application for any immediate issues.
- Validate that the Docker container, created using the `Dockerfile`, is running without errors.

### Performance Tuning
- Analyze the scraper's performance and adjust the rate limiting in `app.py` as needed.
- Profile the application to identify any bottlenecks and optimize the code accordingly.

### Backup and Recovery
- Regularly backup the application data from the `database.py` module.
- Test the recovery process to ensure that data can be restored in case of a failure.

## Updating Documentation

- Keep the `setup_instructions.md` aligned with the current setup procedures after any changes.
- Regularly review and update the `end_user_guide.md` to reflect any new features or changes in the application usage.

## Monitoring Integration

- Ensure that the monitoring tools specified in `monitoring_config.json` are correctly configured and operational.
- Review monitoring alerts and logs to proactively address any potential issues.

## Handling Outages

- In case of an application outage, follow the recovery procedures outlined in the `setup_instructions.md`.
- Investigate the root cause and document the incident to prevent future occurrences.

## Version Control

- Commit all changes to the application codebase, including `app.py`, `scraper.py`, and frontend files like `ScrapeController.js`, `ScrapeView.js`, and `ResultsDisplay.js`, to the version control system.
- Tag releases in the version control system after each deployment for easy rollback if necessary.

## Contact Information

- For immediate assistance, contact the system administrator or the development team.
- For feature requests or bug reports, file an issue in the project's issue tracker.

This maintenance guide should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that it reflects the current state of the application and its maintenance procedures.
